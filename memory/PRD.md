# Construction CRM — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Full-stack Construction CRM (React + FastAPI + MongoDB) for managing pre-sales leads, sales pipeline, project management, HR/payroll, and site operations. Key workflows include automated lead handoff from Pre-Sales → Sales, biometric attendance tracking, and payment processing.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React (port 3000), Shadcn/UI components
- **Backend**: FastAPI (port 8001), prefix `/api`
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (`construction_crm`) + Local MongoDB on Hostinger VPS
- **Auth**: Session cookies (not Bearer tokens)
- **Routes**: `/hr-portal`, `/crm-pre-sales`, `/crm-sales`, `/projects`, `/accounts`
- **Hosting**: Emergent (dev/preview) + Hostinger VPS KVM 4 (production at www.myhomeusb.com)

## What's Been Implemented

### Session — April 28, 2026 — White Screen on `/user-app` (Pre-Sales)
- **Bug**: `<AppHeader />` in `UserApp.jsx` was called without a `user` prop. `AppHeader.jsx:254` unconditionally evaluated `role.replace(...)` which threw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')`, crashing the whole tree into a white screen. Affected any role opening `/user-app` (visible to Pre-Sales & Sales because Super Admin hit other routes first).
- **Fix (2 files)**:
  - `AppHeader.jsx` — made line 254 safe: `{role ? role.replace(/_/g, ' ') : ''}` and `{user?.name || ''}`. Header now renders even while the user object is still hydrating.
  - `UserApp.jsx` — now fetches `/auth/me` on mount and passes `user` prop to `<AppHeader user={user} />` (matches Dashboard/CRMSales/CRMPreSales pattern).
- **Verified**: Logged in as `presales@constructionos.com`, navigated to `/user-app`, page renders fully (Kavitha Nair / PRE SALES chip, all 4 tabs, Generic portfolio link card, testimonial cards). Zero runtime errors.

### Session — April 28, 2026 — Force-Refresh UX Fix
- **Auth caching on force-refresh**: App now hydrates the user state instantly from `sessionStorage` (`mhu_user_cache`) so a browser refresh no longer shows the "Authenticating…" white-screen flash.
  - `App.js` — `cachedUser` seeded from `sessionStorage`; `getAuthUser()` persists on success, removes only on 401/403; `ProtectedRoute` starts `isAuthenticated = true` when cache exists and revalidates `/auth/me` silently in the background. 429/5xx blips on a cached user no longer flash the spinner.
  - `Login.jsx` — writes `sessionStorage.setItem('mhu_user_cache', user)` on successful login.
  - `AppHeader.jsx` + `Login.jsx` — call `window.__clearAuthCache()` on logout/re-login, which removes the sessionStorage key.
  - **Verified via Playwright**: spinner NOT visible immediately after `page.reload()`; cache persists through refresh. Ready to deploy.

### Session — April 27, 2026 (Latest — Custom RE Share Links)
- **Pivot from Prospect Login → Public Token URL** (`/quote/:token`): Sales now share Rough Estimates via a no-login link that expires in 30 days. New module `/app/backend/routes/quote_links.py` (HMAC-signed token = `quote_id.signature[:24]`).
  - Backend endpoints (under `/api`):
    - `POST /leads/{lead_id}/generate-quote-link` — creates link, auto-revokes prior live link, advances lead to `stg_re_to_client` (requires RE to be GM-approved).
    - `GET /leads/{lead_id}/quote-link` — returns `{link, status: live|expired|none}` for the header chip.
    - `GET /public/quote/{token}` — no-auth public quote view; returns `{expired:true, sales_person:{...}}` once 30d elapse.
    - `POST /public/quote/{token}/book-appointment` — public form drops a NEW lead tagged `client_appointment` back to the original sales person + notification.
    - `POST /leads/{lead_id}/regenerate-re` — clones the RE with `revision++`, sends back to Planning with remarks, lead → `stg_re_request`, notification to all_planning.
    - `GET /leads/{lead_id}/timeline` — unified events feed (stages + follow-ups + appointment + payment + quote_links).
  - Frontend:
    - New page `PublicQuoteView.jsx` (mobile-first, mounted at `/quote/:token` BEFORE ProtectedRoute) with **live-quote view** (full RE + 30d countdown chip + Call-Sales CTA) and **expired view** (sales contact card + appointment booking form).
    - `CRMSales.jsx` — "Move to RE Client" replaced with **"Generate RE Link"** + **"Regenerate RE"** buttons. Live/Expired chip + clickable URL with copy. RE Link events appear in the lead Timeline tab. Stage move to `stg_re_to_client` now auto-generates the link (no popup needed).
  - Auto-revoke + signed token = old links return 410 as soon as a fresh link is generated.
  - **Testing**: 15/15 backend pytest cases pass (test_quote_links.py). Frontend public view verified live; data-testids confirmed for detail-generate-re-link-btn / regen-submit-btn / quote-link-status-chip / appt-submit-btn.

### Session — April 27, 2026 (earlier in same day)
- Auto-move lead to **`stg_project_onboarded`** when accountant approves an Advance Income.
- Sales appointment card now displays Site Engineer + Project name on Site Visit / Project Visit stages.
- Quote details expanded to show full Scope items, per-sqft math, and a "What's Included" panel.

### Session — April 23, 2026
- **Unified "Pay & Settle" workflow (Accountant)**: New `PayApprovalDialog` (cheque / current-account / savings / cash with denomination split). Auto-applies vendor's existing suspense balance, computes net payable, and books excess from over-paid cheques back to suspense. Wired into Material + Labour approval rows alongside the legacy Approve/Reject.
  - Backend: `GET /api/approvals/{type}/{id}/pay-context` + `POST /api/approvals/{type}/{id}/pay` (financial.py)
  - Fixed material→`material_expenses` collection mapping (was incorrectly pointing to `material_requests`)

### Session — April 21–22, 2026
- **Unified Accountant Date Filter (P0)**: `CashbookDateFilter` component (Meta-style range picker + Month/Year dropdowns, defaulting to current month) now drives filtering across ALL accountant tabs — Cashbook, Approvals (Income + Expense), Cheque Management (by `cheque_date`), and Project-Wise Summary (refetches `/accountant/cashbook-filtered`). Summary counts & totals now reflect the active range.
- **Timeline Ascending Sort**: Lead Timeline (Pre-Sales + Sales) unifies & sorts events by actual timestamp; Follow-ups split into "Scheduled" + "Closed" events
- **Sales Stages Restructured (13 stages)**: New Appointment → Office Visit → Followup → Client Land Visit → Our Projects Visit → RE-Request → RE-Planning → RE-Client → Negotiation → Deal Close (renamed from Payment Collect) → Accountant Approval → Project Onboarded → Lost. Auto-migration for old stages (Discussion→Followup, Deal Closed→Deal Close, Site Visit Done→RE Request)
- **Sales Header Cleanup**: Removed "Sales CRM" & "RE Projects" text from top nav; added RE Projects button in toolbar
- **Sales UI Parity with Pre-Sales**: Follow-up dialog with Date+Time+Remarks; Quick Record/New buttons on list view; Colorful 2-row stage summary with counts
- **Top 5 old stat cards removed** (Total Leads / Deal Closed / Advance Collected / RE Requested / Converted)
- **Stage tabs scrollbar**: Slim 6px scrollbar no longer overlays tab text
- **UnitSelect Portal + 110+ Construction Units**: Dropdown renders via createPortal with fixed positioning (smart flip-up near bottom), pointer-events+stopPropagation for Radix Dialog, searchable, 11 categories (Count/Weight/Volume/Area/Length/Packaging/Transport/Construction/Electrical/Work/Misc)
- **RE Template Dialog upgrades**: max-w-5xl, table-fixed layout, full-width Description Input
- **RE Edit Dialog upgrades**: max-w-5xl, table-fixed, widened columns
- **NEW: "Use Template" sub-popup inside RE Edit**: Search templates, apply via Replace or Append mode — then edit/reorder/delete/add manually before submit to GM
- **Production deploys**: All changes shipped to www.myhomeusb.com via SSH + git pull + yarn build + pm2 restart
