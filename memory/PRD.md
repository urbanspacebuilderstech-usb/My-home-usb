# My Home USB - Construction Management System PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build a comprehensive labour and materials management system for a Construction OS platform. The system manages projects, site engineers, material procurement, work orders, and daily progress tracking.

## Core Requirements
- Multi-role authentication (Super Admin, Site Engineer, Procurement, Planning, Accountant, HR, etc.)
- Project management with assignments
- Material procurement workflow (request -> approval -> order -> transit -> receive)
- Work order management with contractor-centric flow
- Stock management and daily stock counts
- Daily progress reporting
- Google Sheets integration for data sync
- Email notifications via Resend
- HR Portal with separate Employee profiles and User account creation

## Completed Features

### Pre-existing (before March 2026)
- Full authentication system with demo access
- Project CRUD with multi-role access
- Site Engineer assignment and project views
- Material request workflow (SE -> Planning -> Procurement -> Transit)
- Procurement Board with 7 tabs
- Contractor management and work order creation
- Google Sheets auto-sync
- Email notifications via Resend
- Object Storage for file uploads
- Leaflet/OpenStreetMap integration

### March 2026 Session 1
- Procurement Board Data Seeding
- Site Engineer Order Detail Popup
- Work Orders Tab Rework (contractor-centric)

### March 2026 Session 2
- Phase 1: Enhanced Material Request Flow (approved materials with brands)
- Phase 2: Material Receiving & Stock Management (image uploads, GPS)
- Phase 3: Daily Progress Reports

### March 2026 Session 3
- **Daily Stock Count Report**: Auto-populated inventory table with received materials, opening/closing stock, totals, check-in log
- **User Account Creation (Roles & Credentials tab)**:
  - "Create User" button with form: Link Employee, Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password, Role
  - Super Admin can create/edit/delete any user including HR
  - HR can create users (except super_admin/hr roles) but cannot edit/delete
  - No email onboarding - direct password-based creation
  - Delete user capability for Super Admin
  - Login with email/password for created users
- **Test data cleanup**: Removed 4 TEST_John Doe HR Test records

### March 2026 Session 4
- **Super Admin Setup Wizard**: `/setup` page for first-time Super Admin creation
- **Percentage-Based Payment Stages**: Stages use % of total project value; amounts auto-calculated on backend; hidden from PM role
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Eye icon on all password fields
- **Demo Login CORS Fix**: Fixed CORS config blocking demo logins
- **Global Dialog Z-Index Fix**: Modified `dialog.jsx` with `overflow: visible` to prevent dropdown clipping

### March 2026 Session 5 (Current)
- **Bug Fix - Rough Estimate Dialog (3 bugs)**:
  1. **Unit dropdown stuck**: Moved `overflow-y-auto` from `DialogContent` to inner wrapper div so UnitSelect dropdown renders above dialog
  2. **Decimal input blocked**: Removed premature `parseFloat` from Qty/Rate onChange handlers; parseFloat now only applied during total calculation and save
  3. **Dropdown clipped by dialog**: Same root cause as #1 — inner scroll wrapper pattern applied
- **Feature - GM Can Edit RE Projects**:
  - Added `general_manager` to edit permissions (backend + frontend)
  - Full RE edit dialog in GMDashboard with scope items, unit select, decimal inputs
  - Change log system: tracks field-level changes (old → new) with user name, role, timestamp
  - Edit History UI shown to both GM and Planning in their respective edit dialogs
  - New API: `GET /api/crm/re-projects/{id}/change-logs`
  - New MongoDB collection: `re_change_logs`

## Key API Endpoints
- `POST /api/hr/users/create` - Create user (email/password/role)
- `DELETE /api/hr/users/{user_id}` - Delete user (Super Admin only)
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/approved-materials` - Branded materials
- `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/daily-progress` - Log daily progress
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/received-stock` - Received materials

## Prioritized Backlog

### P1
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with mobile OTP

- Aadhar Document Upload with encrypted storage
- Refactor ProjectDetail.jsx (4000+ lines)

### P2
- Cash Denomination feature (paused)
- Comprehensive UI/UX review
- Convert to SaaS model
- Production deployment guidance
